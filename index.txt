<h2> Postmortem </h2>
<p> 1.      The first thing that we can continue working on this project is artistic part. The assets we use in this game are free assets which downloaded from the web page. Therefore, we can create our own assets if we have more time.<br />
2.      Secondly, we need to work on the jump function which looks quite simple and not smooth in the game. We have improved the movement function but still have not figured out better way to have better jump function. If we have more time, we will work on it.<br />
3.      Our game is more like a combination of doodle jump and Mario. For the map part, we need to think about more on the map space. We are looking forward to reading more books in terms of map design. For our first rule of the game, the key term of this game is anxiety. Hence, to have a better space of creating anxiety is the priority for us if having more time.<br />
4.      Our team encountered a time issue. One of our teammates went to GDC conference so that we could not meet during that period. Therefore, if we have more time, we will plan our team more efficiently. What¡¯s more, we had trouble combining our code together. I think we need to fix this issue by setting more explicit tasks. <br />
