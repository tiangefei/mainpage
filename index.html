<h5> Postmortem </h5>
<p> If we have more time. Firstly, we will implement some steering behaviors for the paddle. At this moment, when the player is pressing A or D, the paddle will move 40 pixels each frame. To make the movement for the paddle smoother, what we can do is when the player is pressing down the key, we will set an initial acceleration for the paddle, and a velocity. Then add the acceleration to the velocity, and add the velocity to paddle¡¯s position. If the player is holding down the key, the velocity will increase until it reaches the maximum speed. When the player releases the key, the acceleration will be set to zero. In this case, if the player holds the key down, the paddle will move faster in a more natural way. <br /> <br />Secondly, this is probably not something we can improve, since we are all programmers. However, when players opened a digital game, before they learn how to play the game, and before they understand the game mechanics. The first thing they will see is the graphics. We believed that a good-looking graphic will make the players have a good first impression about the game, and that is very important for a game to attract players. If we have extra time, we will make some nice looking assets, and put it into our game.
